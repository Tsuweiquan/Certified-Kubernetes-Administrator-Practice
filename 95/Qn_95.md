# Question 95

Change the requested storage size of PersistentVolumeClaim "storage-pvc" to 800Mi

# Setup the env
## Create a PV
kubectl apply -f storage-pv.yaml 
persistentvolume/storage-pv created

## Create a PVC
kubectl apply -f storage-pvc.yaml 
persistentvolumeclaim/storage-pvc created

## Ref
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims

To request a larger volume for a PVC, edit the PVC object and specify a larger size. This triggers expansion of the volume that backs the underlying PersistentVolume. A new PersistentVolume is never created to satisfy the claim. Instead, an existing volume is resized.

Directly editing the size of a PersistentVolume can prevent an automatic resize of that volume. If you edit the capacity of a PersistentVolume, and then edit the .spec of a matching PersistentVolumeClaim to make the size of the PersistentVolumeClaim match the PersistentVolume, then no storage resize happens. The Kubernetes control plane will see that the desired state of both resources matches, conclude that the backing volume size has been manually increased and that no resize is necessary.


# Answer

1. Extract the yaml config of the PVC
2. Delete the PVC
3. Edit the PV to unbound from the old PVC and make it available
4. Update the yaml config in (1) with 800Mi
5. Apply the yaml config
6. Check that PV and PVC are bounded

```
$ kubectl get pv
NAME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                  STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   REASON   AGE
storage-pv   2Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    practice/storage-pvc   manual         <unset>                          4m27s

$ kubectl get pvc
NAME          STATUS   VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS   AGE
storage-pvc   Bound    storage-pv   2Gi        RWO            manual         <unset>                 3m31s

1. Extract the yaml config of the PVC
$ kubectl get pvc -o yaml > patch-storage-pvc.yaml

2. Delete the PVC
kubectl delete pvc storage-pvc

3. Edit the PV to unbound from the old PVC and make it available
kubectl edit pv storage-pv
# remove the claimRef: and status:

4. Update the yaml config in (1) with 800Mi
vim patch-storage-pvc.yaml
# change .spec.resources.requests.storage -> 800Mi

kubectl get pv storage
( you should see Available status)
kubectl get pvc 
( you should see no pvc)

5. Apply the yaml config
kubectl apply -f ans_95.yaml

6. Check that PV and PVC are bounded
kubectl get pv storage
( you should see Bound status)
kubectl get pvc 
( you should see a new pvc)
kubectl get pvc storage-pvc -o yaml
( you should see requests.storage = 800Mi)
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 800Mi

```
